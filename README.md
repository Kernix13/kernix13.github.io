# GitHub Pages - User Site

The second version of [my resume](https://kernix13.github.io/index.html) along with a projects page and stylesheet that is part of a Code:You project. This version was created using the _User site_ options.

The [first version of my resume](https://kernix13.github.io/code-you-resume/) was created as a _Project site_ with the same [files](https://github.com/Kernix13/code-you-resume) but different content and styling.
